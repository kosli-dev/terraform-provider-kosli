# Resource: kosli_custom_attestation_type

Manages a custom attestation type in Kosli. Custom attestation types define how Kosli validates and evaluates evidence from proprietary tools, custom metrics, or specialized compliance requirements.

Custom attestation types define the structure and validation rules for attestations in Kosli. They consist of:

- A JSON Schema that defines the expected structure of attestation data
- JQ rules that evaluate the attestation data for compliance

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kosli = {
      source = "kosli-dev/kosli"
    }
  }
}

# Security scan attestation type
resource "kosli_custom_attestation_type" "security_scan" {
  name        = "security-scan"
  description = "Validates security scan results"

  schema = jsonencode({
    type = "object"
    properties = {
      critical_vulnerabilities = { type = "integer" }
      high_vulnerabilities     = { type = "integer" }
      medium_vulnerabilities   = { type = "integer" }
      scan_date                = { type = "string" }
      scanner_version          = { type = "string" }
    }
    required = ["critical_vulnerabilities", "high_vulnerabilities", "scan_date"]
  })

  jq_rules = [
    ".critical_vulnerabilities == 0",
    ".high_vulnerabilities < 5"
  ]
}

# Code coverage attestation type
resource "kosli_custom_attestation_type" "code_coverage" {
  name        = "code-coverage"
  description = "Validates code coverage metrics"

  schema = jsonencode({
    type = "object"
    properties = {
      line_coverage = {
        type    = "number"
        minimum = 0
        maximum = 100
      }
      branch_coverage = {
        type    = "number"
        minimum = 0
        maximum = 100
      }
      total_lines   = { type = "integer" }
      covered_lines = { type = "integer" }
    }
    required = ["line_coverage", "total_lines", "covered_lines"]
  })

  jq_rules = [
    ".line_coverage >= 80",
    ".branch_coverage >= 70"
  ]
}
```

## Schema Validation

The `schema` attribute must contain a valid JSON Schema (draft-07) that defines the structure of attestation data. Common schema types:

- **Security Scans**: Define vulnerability counts and scan metadata
- **Code Coverage**: Define coverage percentages and test metrics
- **Performance Tests**: Define response times and error rates

### Schema Example

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "critical_vulnerabilities": { "type": "integer" },
    "high_vulnerabilities": { "type": "integer" },
    "scan_date": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["critical_vulnerabilities", "high_vulnerabilities", "scan_date"]
}
```

## JQ Rules

The `jq_rules` attribute contains an array of JQ expressions that must ALL evaluate to `true` for an attestation to be considered compliant. Each rule is evaluated against the attestation data that matches the defined schema.

### JQ Rules Examples

```hcl
jq_rules = [
  ".critical_vulnerabilities == 0",     # No critical vulnerabilities allowed
  ".high_vulnerabilities < 5",          # Less than 5 high vulnerabilities
  ".scan_date != null"                  # Scan date must be present
]
```

## Import

Custom attestation types can be imported using their name:

```shell
# Import an existing custom attestation type by name
terraform import kosli_custom_attestation_type.security_scan security-scan
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `jq_rules` (List of String) List of jq evaluation rules. Each rule is a jq expression that must evaluate to true for the attestation to be considered compliant. Example: `[".coverage >= 80"]`
- `name` (String) Name of the custom attestation type. Must start with a letter or number and can only contain letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, underscores, and tildes. Changing this will force recreation of the resource.
- `schema` (String) JSON Schema definition that defines the structure of attestation data. Can be provided inline using heredoc syntax or loaded from a file using `file()`. Semantic equality is used for comparison, so formatting differences are ignored.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the custom attestation type. Explains what this attestation type validates.
