{{ .Description | trimspace }}

Use this data source to retrieve information about an existing custom attestation type. This is useful for:

- Referencing existing attestation types in other configurations
- Creating variants of existing types with modified rules
- Querying attestation type metadata and schemas

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/data-sources/kosli_custom_attestation_type/data-source.tf"}}

## Querying Archived Types

By default, the data source retrieves active (non-archived) attestation types. Archived types can be queried but are read-only and typically represent historical configurations.

The `archived` attribute indicates whether an attestation type has been deleted/archived in Kosli. Archived types cannot be modified through Terraform.
