Environments represent runtime locations where artifacts are deployed and tracked for compliance monitoring. Use this data source to:

- Reference existing environment configurations in other resources
- Monitor environment activity (last modified, last reported timestamps)
- Create conditional logic based on environment state
- Build alerts and notifications based on environment metadata

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/data-sources/kosli_environment/data-source.tf"}}

## Monitoring with Data Sources

The data source exposes timestamp fields that are useful for monitoring:

- `last_modified_at`: Unix timestamp of when the environment configuration was last changed
- `last_reported_at`: Unix timestamp of when the environment last reported a snapshot (can be null if never reported)

These timestamps enable you to:

- Create alerts for environments that haven't reported in a certain time period
- Track configuration changes across your infrastructure
- Build dashboards showing environment activity
- Implement conditional deployment logic based on environment state

## Read-Only Access

Data sources provide read-only access to environment metadata. To modify environment configurations, use the `kosli_environment` resource.
