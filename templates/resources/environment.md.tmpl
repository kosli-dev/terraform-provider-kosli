Kosli environments track deployments and provide visibility into what's running in your infrastructure. Physical environments represent actual runtime locations such as:

- **K8S**: Kubernetes clusters
- **ECS**: Amazon Elastic Container Service clusters
- **S3**: Amazon S3 buckets
- **docker**: Docker containers
- **server**: Bare-metal or VM servers
- **lambda**: AWS Lambda functions

**Note**: This provider currently supports only physical environments. Logical environments (which aggregate other environments) are not yet supported.

**Note**: Environment tags are managed through a separate Kosli API and are not included in this Terraform resource.

**Note**: Environment policies will be available in a future release as a separate resource (`kosli_environment_policy`).

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/kosli_environment/resource.tf"}}

## Environment Types

The `type` attribute must be one of the following physical environment types:

- `K8S` - Kubernetes clusters
- `ECS` - Amazon Elastic Container Service
- `S3` - Amazon S3 buckets
- `docker` - Docker containers
- `server` - Bare-metal or VM servers
- `lambda` - AWS Lambda functions

## Configuration Options

### Include Scaling

The `include_scaling` attribute (default: `false`) determines whether scaling events in the environment should be tracked. This is useful for environments with auto-scaling where you want to monitor scale-up and scale-down events.

## Import

Environments can be imported using their name:

{{codefile "shell" "examples/resources/kosli_environment/import.sh"}}

## Monitoring Environments

For querying environment metadata such as `last_modified_at` and `last_reported_at` timestamps, use the `kosli_environment` data source. This is useful for monitoring and creating conditional logic based on environment state.
